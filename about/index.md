<p class="about-me-text">
I'm a software engineer from the Boston area. I graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Science and have stayed in the area ever since. I was most recently the VP of Engineering at EightSpokes in Cambridge, MA. I left the position to pursue my own thing, but I'm still a consultant and technical advisor to EightSpokes. I was previously a senior software engineer at Oracle and Phase Forward.

<p class="about-me-text">
I'm currently specializing in web development with Ruby on Rails and javascript frameworks like Backbone.js. I'm also experienced with object oriented design, web services and data modeling.

<p class="about-me-text">
When not tinkering with code and learning new things, I'm playing soccer, watching basketball, watching shows like Game of Thrones and relaxing with my fiancee.
