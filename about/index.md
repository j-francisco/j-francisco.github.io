I'm a freelance software developer from the Boston area. I plan, design and develop software for various industries, from prototypes and MVPs to large scale, mature products. I was most recently the VP of Engineering at EightSpokes in Cambridge, MA. I left the position to pursue my own thing, but I'm still a consultant and technical advisor to EightSpokes. I was previously a Senior Software Engineer at Oracle and Phase Forward. I graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Science and have stayed in the area ever since.

I'm currently specializing in web development with Ruby on Rails and javascript frameworks like Backbone.js. I'm also experienced with object oriented design, web services and data modeling. Some more of my top skills are Python, C#/.NET and SQL.

When not tinkering with code and learning new things, I'm playing soccer, watching basketball, watching shows like Game of Thrones and relaxing with my fiancee.
