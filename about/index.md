I'm a software developer from the Boston area and sole proprietor of JF Software LLC.
I plan, design and develop software for various industries, from prototypes and MVPs to large scale,
mature products.

I started an LLC to provide software development consulting to start-ups and medium-size companies. 
I was most recently the VP of Engineering at EightSpokes in Cambridge, MA. 
Prior to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at Oracle and Phase Forward.
I graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Science and have stayed in the area ever since.

I'm currently specializing in web development with React/Redux/ES6 and Ruby on Rails,
and also have experience with Python, Angular, Backbone, C#/.NET, object oriented design, APIs and data modeling.

When not tinkering with code and learning new things, I'm playing soccer, watching basketball, watching shows like Game of Thrones and relaxing with my wife and cat.
