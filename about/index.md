I'm a software developer in the North Shore / Boston area and sole proprietor of JF Software LLC.
I plan, design and develop software for various industries, from prototypes and MVPs to large scale,
mature products.

I started an LLC to provide software development consulting to start-ups and medium-size companies. I also work full-time at HighRes Biosolutions as a Principal Software Engineer, building desktop applications and web services for controlling laboratory automation devices, using C#/.NET/WPF. Previously I was the VP of Engineering at EightSpokes, a start up in Cambridge, MA, and prior to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at Oracle and Phase Forward.
I graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Science.

As a freelance developer, I specialize in web and mobile development with React/React Native/Redux/ES6 and Ruby on Rails. I also have experience with Python, Angular, Backbone, object oriented design, APIs and data modeling.

When not tinkering with code and learning new things I'm playing soccer, watching basketball or hanging out with my wife, son and cat.
