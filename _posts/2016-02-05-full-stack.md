Imagine you were having a new house built, and now it’s time to do the plumbing. Would you have the painters do the plumbing or a professional plumber? Well, the painters have been around houses while the plumbers were working, so they picked up a few pointers on how plumbing works. So why not hire the painters to do the plumbing and call them full stack house builders?

That’s basically what the start-up tech world has been doing with the idea of full stack developers. I’ve seen college grads looking for full stack developer positions, and even worse, companies looking to hire "junior full stack developers". That’s not possible. To be truly full stack, you need to have spent enough time in each part of the stack to be proficient in it. The stack is a lot more than HTML, javascript and a server side framework. It includes things like database optimization, hosting and deployment, performance, UX, dealing with customer issues and requests. Not to mention actually being good at object oriented design and algorithms for the business logic, as well as UI design, CSS and all the javascript in between. But there’s nothing wrong with just being really good at some of those.

I think the idea of a full stack developer is a way for entrepreneurs and investors to squeeze as much as they can out of their engineers. Why hire a back-end specialist and a front end specialist when you can hire a full stack developer to do both jobs and you don’t even have to pay them double the salary? That concept is focused on doing more in less time with fewer resources. I understand that, and can see how that is important for start-ups, but let’s not kid ourselves into thinking we’re building better software by being full stack developers. __Some piece of the stack is eventually going to bite you if your team doesn’t have an expert on it.__

I’d rather be a software engineer with experience in various areas. Maybe that phrase doesn’t fit on a resume nicely so people shortened it to "full stack developer”. But we need to re-think this area of hiring engineers. Interviewers should be looking for engineers with the particular skills needed to fill the roles in their teams. Engineers should be presenting their areas of expertise for filling these roles. Then they can supplement that with their understanding of the rest of the stack to show they can make good design decisions that won’t negatively affect the rest of the software.

I’m not saying there’s absolutely no such thing as a full stack developer. I’m just saying if you are one, you should probably be interviewing for principal/director/CTO roles, and not “junior full stack developer”. Then you can focus on building a team of back-end, front-end and design experts so you can really build great products.
